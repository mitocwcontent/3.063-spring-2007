Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Textbook
--------

There is no required textbook for this course. A suggested reference is:

Young, R. J., and P. A. Lovell. _Introduction to Polymers_. 2nd ed. Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press, 2000. ISBN: 9780748757404.

Assignments
-----------

Students must complete and hand in five problem sets during the term.

Students are also required to write a substantial essay on an area concerning the structure, processing, and physical properties of polymers. A two page detailed outline is due on Lec #13 and the paper is due seven days after Lec #23.

Exams
-----

There will be two in-class exams.
